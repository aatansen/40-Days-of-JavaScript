# **Module 1 - Getting Started with JavaScript**

## **Day 01 - Introduction to JavaScript & Setting Up Environments**

### JavaScript & It's History

- **1995 – Brendan Eich creates JavaScript in 10 days at Netscape**

  - Designed to add dynamic behavior to web pages.
  - Initially called *Mocha*, then *LiveScript*, before being renamed *JavaScript*.
  - Integrated into Netscape Navigator 2.

- **1996 – Microsoft releases JScript for Internet Explorer**

  - JScript was Microsoft’s implementation of JavaScript for IE 3.
  - Created to avoid licensing Netscape’s engine.
  - Helped establish cross-browser scripting (though with incompatibilities).

- **1997 – ECMAScript (ES1) is standardized**

  - ECMA International adopted the language as ECMAScript.
  - The first edition (ES1) defined a formal specification.
  - Gave JavaScript a vendor-neutral standard.

- **1999 – ES3 introduces Regex & exception handling**

  - Brought `try/catch` for error handling.
  - Added regular expressions for string pattern matching.
  - Enhanced string and array methods.

- **2005 – AJAX revolutionizes web interactivity**

  - Coined by Jesse James Garrett.
  - Uses `XMLHttpRequest` to fetch data asynchronously.
  - Enabled modern web apps like Google Maps and Gmail.

- **2006 – jQuery simplifies JavaScript**

  - Created by John Resig.
  - Provided a simple API for DOM traversal, events, and AJAX.
  - Dramatically reduced cross-browser issues.

- **2009 – ES5 brings JSON support, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`**

  - Standardized `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`.
  - Added array helpers: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`.
  - Introduced strict mode (`"use strict"`).

- **2010 – AngularJS popularizes front-end frameworks**

  - Built by Google.
  - Introduced declarative templates and two-way data binding.
  - Inspired the SPA (Single Page Application) movement.

- **2013 – React.js changes UI development widely**

  - Created at Facebook.
  - Introduced a virtual DOM for efficient rendering.
  - Emphasized component-based architecture.

- **2014 – ECMAScript updates become annual**

  - TC39 adopted a yearly release cadence (“ES2015+” model).
  - Allowed incremental evolution rather than rare, big updates.

- **2015 – ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduces major features**

  - `let` and `const` for block scoping.
  - Arrow functions, template literals, and default parameters.
  - Classes, modules (`import`/`export`), `Promise`, and `Map`/`Set`.

- **2016 – Vue.js gains popularity as an alternative to React**

  - Created by Evan You.
  - Lightweight, progressive framework.
  - Easier learning curve than Angular or React.

- **2017 – ES8 adds async/await**

  - Simplified working with Promises.
  - Added `Object.entries()` and `Object.values()`.
  - Brought `String.padStart()`/`padEnd()`.

- **2019 – ES10 introduces optional catch binding and `flatMap()`**

  - Optional `catch` parameter (`catch { ... }`).
  - `Array.prototype.flat()` and `flatMap()` for easier array manipulation.
  - `Object.fromEntries()` added.

- **2020 – Deno (by Ryan Dahl) challenges Node.js**

  - Written in Rust, uses V8 engine.
  - Secure by default: no file/network access without flags.
  - Built-in TypeScript support and ES modules.

- **2021 – ES12 adds logical assignment operators**

  - Operators: `&&=`, `||=`, `??=`.
  - Numeric separators (`1_000_000`) improve readability.
  - `WeakRef` and `FinalizationRegistry` introduced.

- **2022 – ES13 introduces `at()` for arrays and top-level `await`**

  - `Array.prototype.at()` allows negative indices.
  - Top-level `await` simplifies module loading.
  - `Object.hasOwn()` as a safe alternative to `hasOwnProperty`.

- **2023 – ES14 brings Array grouping (`groupBy()`)**

  - `Array.prototype.groupBy()` and `groupByToMap()`.
  - Refines ergonomics for class fields and private methods.
  - String enhancements and iterator helpers (proposal stage).

- **2024 – React Server Components (RSC) revolutionize web app performance**

  - Enables rendering React components on the server.
  - Reduces client-side JavaScript bundle size.
  - Improves time-to-interactive for complex apps.

- **2025 – JavaScript evolves with AI-driven features & WebAssembly advancements**

  - Integration with WebAssembly becomes tighter.
  - Experimental proposals for built-in AI helpers (e.g., ML APIs).
  - Continuous optimization for performance and concurrency.

### Environment Setup

- Set up Links
  - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  - [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### First Line of JS Code

- `Right click` and `inspect` or `F12` key press to open console in browser

  ```js
  console.log("Hello World")
  ```

- Run the Code in VsCode
  - Open a [html file](./Day%2001%20-%20Introduction%20to%20JavaScript%20&%20Setting%20Up%20Environments/first.html)
  - Put `script` tag before the body end tag and write JavaScript code inside `script` tag

    ```html
    <body>

    <script>
        console.log("Hello World")
    </script>
    </body>
    ```

- Another way is creating seperated script file
  - Create [script file](./Day%2001%20-%20Introduction%20to%20JavaScript%20&%20Setting%20Up%20Environments/test.js)
  - Add it before the end of `head` tag

    ```html
    <head>
        ...
        <script src="./test.js"></script>
    </head>
    ```

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### Problem with including the script in the head tag

- When we add script in the head it works like this diagram

  ![JS Loading Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/11nXLoU.png)

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - test.js:3 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerText') at test.js:3:44

- This error occured because DOM isn’t ready when the script runs
- Here is another visualization

  ```mermaid

### Including script in the body tag

- When adding script befor the end of body tag it will work cause DOM is properly build and runs the script

  ```html
  <body>
  ...
    <script src="./test.js"></script>
  </body>
  ```

- But there is a problem when script is required to load first

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### The async attribute

- Now let's solve the problem by adding it back to the head and add `async` attribute

  ```html
  <head>
    ...
    <script src="./test.js" async></script>
  </head>
  ```

- But again there is a problem if we see the diagram it also have remaining DOM to build which continues after script execution
- There is still usecase of `async` when it does not depend on html page DOM to build
  - Third part library
  - Chatbot
  - Social media interaction etc

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### The defer attribute

- Now let's solve the problem by adding it back to the head and add `defer` attribute

  ```html
  <head>
    ...
    <script src="./test.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  ```

- As it is said by its name `defer` which is postpone for done in future that execute the script

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### Running JavaScript on the Server side

- We can run the script using node

  ```sh
  node test.js
  ```

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### **Day 01 Tasks**

#### Task 01: Setting Up Your Environment

- [x] Install VS Code (if not installed).
- [x] Set up Live Server or open the HTML file directly in a browser.
- [x] Open the DevTools Console (Right-click → Inspect → Console).

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

#### Task 02: Write Your First JavaScript Code

- Create a new file: `index.html`.
- Add a `<script>` tag inside the HTML file or link an external `script.js`.
- Inside `script.js`, write a simple greeting program:

  ```js
  console.log("Hello, tapaScript!");
  console.log("Welcome to 40 Days of JavaScript!");
  document.write("Check the browser console for a message!");
  ```

- Run the HTML file in the browser and check:
  - The console log prints the text.
  - The `document.write()` outputs text on the webpage.

---

- Task 02 Solution
  - Created [index.html](./Day%2001%20-%20Introduction%20to%20JavaScript%20&%20Setting%20Up%20Environments/Task%2002/index.html)
  - Added script tag in [HTML file](./Day%2001%20-%20Introduction%20to%20JavaScript%20&%20Setting%20Up%20Environments/Task%2002/index.html)
  - Run the HTML file in browser using live server extension
    - Console log properly showing
    - `document.write()` outputs text on the webpage is properly showing

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

#### Task 03: Experiment with Different JavaScript Loading Methods

- Add the script in `<head>`, end of the `<body>` tag.
- Use `async` and `defer` attributes
- Understand the difefrences.

---

- Task 03 Solution
  - Created a [script.js](./Day%2001%20-%20Introduction%20to%20JavaScript%20&%20Setting%20Up%20Environments/Task%2003/script.js)
  - Add it in `<head>` of [index.html](./Day%2001%20-%20Introduction%20to%20JavaScript%20&%20Setting%20Up%20Environments/Task%2003/index.html)
  - Used `async` and `defer` and notice that `document.write()` is showing error

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - script.js:2 Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': It isn't possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external script unless it is explicitly opened.

- Also found that `defer` hold the execution of JS till DOM is build but `async` interrupt the DOM build and execute the JS which is shown in the diagram mentioned in [Problem with including the script in the head tag](#problem-with-including-the-script-in-the-head-tag)

#### Task 04: Take Notes and Submit

- [x] Note down done
- [x] Shared the progress on discord

## **Day 02 - Variables and Data Types in JavaScript**

### What are variables?

- Variables are used to store data in JavaScript
- Variables are like a box that hold some information
- For example when we write someone / friend address on a paper in here paper is the variable and the address is the value

  ![Variable](https://i.imgur.com/mWBq5f3.png)

  ```js
  let/const/var storage_name = value;

  let fruit = "mango";
  ```

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

#### Value Assignments

- When we use `let` we can re-assign value

  ```js
  // value re-assign
  let fruit="mango"
  fruit="kiwi"
  console.log(fruit);
  ```

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### Naming Convention

- The name must have digits(0-9) or letters.
- The name can have `$` and `_`
- The first character must not be a digit.
- No Reserved Keywords

  ```js
  // Naming Convention
  let $ = "doller"
  console.log($);
  let _ ="underscore";
  console.log(_);

  // not valid name convention
  // let 2morrow;
  // let react-play;

  // Case sensitive
  let myName;
  let MyName;
  ```

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

#### Variable Name Standards

- Use camelCase.
- Human Readable.
- The name should match the
cause.

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### Comments

- Single line comment `//`

  ```js
  // this is single line comment
  ```

- Multi line comment `/* ... */`

  ```js
  /*
  this
  is
  multi
  line
  comment
  */
  ```

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### let var const

- `var`: Function-scoped, can be redeclared (not recommended)
- `let`: Block-scoped, can be reassigned
- `const`: Block-scoped, **cannot** be reassigned
- Problem with `var`

  ```js
  // let var const
  var address = "Dhaka"
  console.log(address);

  var address = "USA"
  console.log(address);
  ```

  - Here `address` is being re-declare without any issue which is a problem

> [!NOTE]
>
> - A variable declare should be done once
> - Re-assign the same variable as much as needed
> - Using `var` is not recommended due to being functional scope and re-declare variable issue

[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### Data Types

- Primitive (immutable, stored by value)
  - Number – integers, floats, NaN, Infinity
    - *Example*: `let age = 25; let pi = 3.14; let notANumber = NaN;`
  - String – text enclosed in quotes
    - *Example*: `let greeting = "Hello";`
  - Boolean – `true or false`
    - *Example*: `let isLoggedIn = true;`
  - Null – intentional empty value
    - *Example*: `let emptyValue = null;`
  - Undefined – variable declared but not assigned
    - *Example*: `let x; // undefined`
  - Symbol – unique and immutable identifier
    - *Example*: `let id = Symbol("uniqueId");`
  - BigInt – large integers beyond Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
    - *Example*: `let big = 123456789012345678901234567890n;`

- Non-Primitive (reference types, stored by reference)
  - Object
    - Plain objects ({}) – Key-value pairs of data

      Example:
      `const user = { username: "alex", age: 25 };`

    - Arrays ([]) – Ordered list of values

      Example:
      `const numbers = [1, 2, 3];`

    - Functions – Blocks of code that can be called

      Example:
      `function greet() { console.log("Hello!"); }`

    - Dates (new Date()) – Represent date and time

      Example:
      `const today = new Date();`

    - Regular Expressions (/pattern/) – Patterns to match text

      Example:
      `const regex = /hello/i;`

    - Maps (new Map()) – Store key-value pairs with any type of key

      Example:

      ```js
      const map = new Map();
      map.set("a", 1);
      ```

    - Sets (new Set()) – Store unique values

      Example:
      `const set = new Set([1, 2, 2, 3]);`

    - WeakMap / WeakSet – Store objects as keys or values, allow garbage collection

      Example:

      ```js
      const weakMap = new WeakMap();
      const obj = {};
      weakMap.set(obj, "value");
      ```

#### `undefined` vs `null`

| Aspect             | `undefined`                       | `null`                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Default or manual? | Default for uninitialized vars    | Manually assigned      |
| Type               | `undefined`                       | `object`               |
| Meaning            | Variable not yet assigned a value | Intentional “no value” |
| Checked by         | `typeof value === "undefined"`    | `value === null`       |

#### Pass by Value & Pass by Reference

- Pass by Value
  - Applies to **Primitive** types (Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt)
  - A copy of the value is passed to the variable or function
  - Changing the new variable does **not** affect the original value

- Pass by Reference
  - Applies to **Non-Primitive** types (Objects, Arrays, Functions, etc.)
  - A reference (memory address) is passed, not the actual value
  - Changes made through the new variable affect the original object

  ```js
  // Pass by Value  (Primitive)
  let fruit2 = "mango"
  let vegetable = "carrots"
  fruit2 = vegetable
  fruit2 = "banana"
  console.log(vegetable);
  ```
